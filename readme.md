# DESC Project 411: Quantifying the impact of galaxy catalog conditions on dark sirens

We aim to quantify the constraining power of dark sirens under different observational conditions, using SkySim5000 as the host galaxy catalog, and simulated Bilby GW events as the GW host catalog. We will test at minimum three different galaxy catalog conditions: i) LSST photometric limits on SkySim5000 catalog, i) Photo-z errors impact on H0 PE, and iii) Galaxy completeness effects. We also will test GW host catalog constraints, including i) GW event localization completely enclosed in galaxy survey footprint, ii) GW event localization partially enclosed in galaxy survey footprint, and iii) GW host galaxy inside/outside of galaxy survey footprint. This project will have four deliverables; Goal 1: Deliver CBC host catalogs for testing methods. Goal 2: Validate dark siren statistical methods with simulated catalogs. Goal 3: Test different galaxy and GW host conditions. Goal 4: Deliver the first pipeline for integrating GW-cosmology to LSST catalogs.
