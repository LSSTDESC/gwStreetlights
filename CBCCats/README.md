# Creating CBC host catalogs

Here we have the code for simulating CBC host catalogs.

-  `SkySim_hosts_prob.ipynb` is used to simulate a host catalog over the whole sky using the small SkySim5000 catalog (~50 deg^2)
    -  This used a model described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07904)

The simulated catalogs are saved in the `~/data/` folder
